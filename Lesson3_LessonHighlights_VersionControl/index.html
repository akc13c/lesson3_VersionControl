            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is one location on the Internet which files can be stored, altered, and uploaded by a group of web developers. Each file is saved separately and this insures that codes cannot be overwritten by one person in a team of developers.   This is the solution for file sharing during a team project. Version control systems offer a lot of information about files and their alterations. For example you can view what time the file was altered, who changed it, and it can indicate what was different about the previous files that were saved.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are necessary for web developers to insure files are not overwritten by other team members. A few of the benefits about Version control systems that interest web developers are that a team can would on the same file without their code being messed with by other team members. It also allows developers to go back to older files before their code was changed. They provide backups and also a common repository where files that were recently changed can be found.  Version control Systems offer a positive work space for a team of developers to express their personal ideas and works without altering their other team members.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems have two repositories. The first repository is a Remote repository. This repository is located on a specific server that is used by members of a web development team. Basically, this is where a team of web developers store all of the files ever create for a project. The second repository is a local repository. A local repository is different from a remote repository because it can be used on an individual developers computer. A local repository can be created in two ways. The first way is by just creating a new repository. The second way to create a local repository is to copy a remote repository so it can be on a web developers computer. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Github?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is a popular Version control system for web developers. It is and open source and it is also free for developers to use and express their ideas among their teams. Github is a easy to use and flexible to connect other programs to. For example, connecting Cloud9 to our Github accounts in assignment 3. Github is a local repository, there for web developers can work off of their person laptops and desktops. Github also keeps copies of all of the codes interned into its repository.
Github will also never overwrite a team’s files in a repository. This is why so many developers use Github.

                <span class="text-muted">Git commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using Git, there are commands that are used to direct files into the repository. A few commands that were used in this assignment were git init, git add -- all, git commit, git log, and git status. These commands were entered into the terminal of the index.html file on our Cloud 9 accounts. Each command does something different. For example, a local repository is created by the command “git init”. These commands do three things. They add files to your local repository, they commit files to your local repository, and these files are then pushed to a remote repository. </p>
